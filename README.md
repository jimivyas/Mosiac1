# First Mosiac Assignment

Writing the method to sort was the easiest part, but deciding what I should accept was difficult. I ended up deciding that repeated events would be ignored and that if it wasn't in the proper format it would be rejected entirely. As long as :date matches the year-month-day pattern, though, with roughly valid numbers (feb 30 would work for example), and the entire array is full of hashes, the rest of the hash will be added. It would be pretty easy to fix that by checking the days/month but wouldn't really reflect on my skills at all.
